# belly-button-challenge

The present repo contains the Java script code needed to build an interactive dashboard to explore a modified belly button biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 

The dataset reveals that a small proportion of bacterial species, refer to here as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare, and potentially unique to each individual. 

Also known as the microbiome, results show that each subject's navel contains specific bacteria in varying abundances. 

For instance, the barplot shows the top 10 most abundant OTUs in each selected individual, along with a text string containing the name of the OTU at different taxonomic levels. Depending on how specific the classification algorithm performed, some bacterial OTUs were not classified beyond the kingdom level (Bacteria), while others were classified up to the genus level.

The bubble plot showcases the OTU ID on the x-axis, and the abundance of each OTU on the y-axis. The abundance of each OTU is also represented with the size of the bubbles.
